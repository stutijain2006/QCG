# QCG Website

Here is my submission for the Web Development vertical of the Quantum Computing Group (QCG) Club. I have designed and implemented an interactive homepage for the club's website, showcasing various initiatives and activities of QCG. The website features a media gallery to display images and a feedback section to collect user feedback.
